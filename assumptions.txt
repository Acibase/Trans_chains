To reconstructing the transmission chains we made the following assumptions: 1.a patient can be infected/colonized on the first day of hospital stay; he/she immediately becomes infectious and remains infectious until last hospital discharge2. transmission can occur regardless of the length of the contact3.a patient can carry more than 1 genotype, but each transmission is of single genotype4.a SNP cannot reverse to its original state, implying that the donor transmits only his/her established genotype which can be possibly extended by accumulation of additional SNPs after the sample collection and before transmission, hence the receiver must match/extend donor’s genotype (this also allows for new SNP to occur in receiver after infection but before sample collection)5.a plasmid can be independently lost, thus presence/absence of plasmid is not considered in identifying potential transmission events6.individual rooms are considered as “distinct” wards7.a continuous patient stay in the same ward but on different beds is considered as a single ward stay (i.e., no bed-space resolution)8.there can be more than one SNP genotype present in an operating theatre at the same time.Upon collecting the temporal, spatial and genomic information, a network was built where two isolates A and B are directionally connected if A is a potential donor to B, satisfying the temporal and spatial constraints. Next, for each patient’s isolates, all potential donors are investigated and the most likely donors were selected based on SNP genotype similarities; in cases of equal SNP distance, when possible, preference is given to mutation within host, rather than cross-transmission. This process is recursive and terminates when the index case is reached, or it reaches an isolate with no potential donors.
